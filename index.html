        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <h3>Elements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Text Elements</li>
            <li>Image Elements</li>
            <li>Header Elements</li>
            <li>List Elements</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements
            <br />are known as child elements. The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element is known as the parent element. This “parent/child” language<br />
            is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</p>
