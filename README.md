# prework-study-guide

Welcome to the Bootcamp Study Guide README.

## Description

This repository is to store the Bootcamp Study Guide. 

As an aspiring developer, I want to be able to solve real world problem with web applications.

I built this project to aid not only myself but other students on their developer journey.

This Bootcamp Study Guide solves the problem students have, not having a simple place to keep important information.

Building the Study Guide, I learned:

- How to create a HTML page and why these pages are fundamental to projects. 

- That CSS allows you to transform the look of the web page to give the user a better experience. 

- That JavaScript allows me to add interactivity to the web page which add to the user experience and solve problems they may face, using code. 

- That Git is a version control system which will benefit me as a developer as it allows me to manage and keep track of versions of a project.
